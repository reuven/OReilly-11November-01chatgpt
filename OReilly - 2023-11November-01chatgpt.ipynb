    "Large-language model -- it's based on machine learning. The idea is that if you \"train\" a machine-learning model, it will see patterns. When you ask it to classify an image or text, it'll look at its library of patterns, and based on that make decisions and produce output.  ChatGPT is what's known as \"generative\" AI -- it doesn't only know how to classify things, but it also knows how to create things, especially text.\n",

It'll produce one word, then figure out what is the most likely next word it should show, then what is the most likely next word it should show after that, etc. etc. etc. \n",
